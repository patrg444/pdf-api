# üîç RapidAPI Navigation Help

You're currently in the "Applications" section. You need to go to the **Provider Dashboard** instead.

## How to Get to the Right Place:

### 1. Look for Provider/Publisher Section
- In the top navigation or sidebar, look for:
  - **"Provider"**
  - **"Publisher"**  
  - **"My APIs"**
  - **"Provider Dashboard"**

### 2. Or Try Direct Link:
Go to: https://rapidapi.com/provider

### 3. Switch to Provider Mode
- You might need to switch from "Consumer" to "Provider" mode
- Look for a toggle or dropdown to switch roles

## Once You're in Provider Dashboard:

You should see:
- **"Add New API"** button
- **"My APIs"** section
- **"Analytics"** for your APIs

## üéØ Key Difference:

- **Applications** = For consuming other people's APIs (what you're in now)
- **Provider/Publisher** = For publishing YOUR API (where you need to be)

## If You Can't Find It:

1. Log out and log back in
2. When logging in, choose "I want to publish APIs"
3. Or go directly to: https://rapidapi.com/provider

## Need the Application Key?

If RapidAPI is asking for an application key for your API:
- The "Application Key" shown in your current screen is for CONSUMING APIs
- For publishing, you need the **Proxy Secret** from the Provider dashboard

Let me know once you're in the Provider Dashboard and see the "Add New API" button!
