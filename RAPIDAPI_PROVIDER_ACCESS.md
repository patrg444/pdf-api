# ðŸš¨ You're in the Wrong Section!

You're seeing the **Consumer Application** page (for using other APIs).
You need the **Provider/Publisher** section (for publishing YOUR API).

## Try These Steps:

### Option 1: Look for Profile Menu
1. Click on your profile icon (top right)
2. Look for:
   - **"My APIs"**
   - **"Provider Dashboard"**
   - **"Publisher Dashboard"**
   - **"Switch to Provider"**

### Option 2: Direct URLs
Try these links:
- https://rapidapi.com/user/provider
- https://rapidapi.com/dashboard
- https://rapidapi.com/my-apis

### Option 3: Navigation Bar
Look at the very top of the page for:
- A toggle between **"Consumer"** and **"Provider"**
- Or tabs/menu items for **"My APIs"** or **"Provider"**

### Option 4: Create Provider Account
If you can't find Provider options:
1. Go to: https://rapidapi.com/auth/provider-signup
2. Or click "Become a Provider" if you see it anywhere

## ðŸ”‘ Key Difference:

### What You're Seeing (Consumer):
- Application Key: `501d39e59fmsh9d1dcf017099874p12f8ecjsn32ca60a4d2cb`
- This is for USING other people's APIs

### What You Need (Provider):
- Provider Dashboard
- "Add New API" button
- Proxy Secret (different from Application Key)

## Can't Find It?

The RapidAPI interface might have changed. Look for any option that says:
- "Publish API"
- "Add API"
- "Provider"
- "Publisher"
- "My APIs"

Or try logging out and when you log back in, choose "I want to publish APIs" if that option appears.
